        "about": "Photography has been my passion since I was very young. I shot my first photos when I was a teenager with an analog Canon AV1 film camera. I worked as a journalist photographer for a few months when I was around 18. Later I decided to take photos almost every day as a hobby. I currently shoot with a Canon DSLR 70D and a collection of different lenses as follows: Canon wide 10-18mm F4/5.6, prime 50mm F1.8, prime wide 24mm F2.8, zoom 18-135mm F3.5/5.6, and zoom 75-300mm F4/5.6. I am interested in different genres and styles, but my favorite ones are street, low-light, minimalist, and black and white photography.",
